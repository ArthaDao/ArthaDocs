{% hint style="info" %}
**Total Supply = 1 Billion $ARTHA tokens**
{% endhint %}

## Key info

1. **Liquidity is 100% burnt** right since launch :fire:, meaning the LP tokens were [sent](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7b8559bd1ac8eda598e16752f4e3019f29b4cb6eb961faf1d75e27abf9ca4689) to ETH burn address.
2. **Taxes are on the higher side at the moment is 5/15**. Since we launched at 1$ MC, there are quite a few holders with large supply. Keeping the taxes high gives us enough liquidity and assets to tackle major sells and sustain our growth, also keeping new investors safer. Taxes shall become 5/5 over time with better distribution and growth.
3. Our ETH $ARTHA [contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0x73ee3488113d6567fa98a29943cf21ff48d0658c#code) = 0x73ee3488113d6567fa98a29943cf21ff48d0658c . **It wont be renounced** as we will be a utility based project and we need access to manage things as needed.
