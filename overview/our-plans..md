**We don't have a fixed roadmap, but rather a flexible growth map:**&#x20;

## Building a community that engages.

We started our community on [**Telegram**](https://t.me/ArthaDao), just like every token out there, and soon realised that it was getting overwhelmingly filled with folks who were not part of the project. So a decision was made to get the community token gated. We used the toolset provided by [Collab Land](https://docs.collab.land/docs/tutorials/token-gating-tutorial) to allow only folks with a minimum number of $ARTHA tokens entry to the community chat.&#x20;

## Awesome Feature Two

Get amazing things done with awesome feature two. But remember that awesome feature one and three exist too. In fact, Awesome Product is full of awesome features.
